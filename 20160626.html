<h1>Escape from Google</h1>

<p>I did similar project — because i don’t like <a href="http://www.naver.com">Naver</a>, which is the most popular search engine in Korea. There are several reasons why i don’t like Naver<p>
	<ul>
<li>Dirty homepage : Dirty ads, Dirty portal UI, Dirty curation of news or trivial life information
Controlling search ranking</li>
<li>Occupying the map data of South Korea : </li>
<li>Closed search environment : someone makes content using Naver’s blog service, the content cannot be searched by other search engine, because Naver don’t open the raw data of content(as code) to the public. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>So, I decided to use Google rather than Naver. It can be heard weird for the people outside of Korea(or people in US), but most of koreans use Naver as default search engine, news stand and mail provider. It was successful since Google’s services win in almost every aspects…except when i wanted to find information which created from Naver(ex. blog posting powered by Naver). After this experience, It is weird now i try to escape from Google.</p>
<Br>

<p>First I need to figure out why Google is mattered.</p>
<Br>


<h3><i>Is Google that deep into my life?</i></h3>
Not that much.
<Br>

<h3><i>What’s the hardest part if i try to escape from Google?</i></h3>
Drive? 
<Br>

<h3><i>List all the items you used in Google.</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mail : I will set autoforward option to other account during the prompt week.</li>
<li>drive : I record whole cost in NYC every day using Google spreadsheet. I plan to put them in memo application in my macbook… // I subscribe google drive upgrade option(expand to 100gb) if this prompt isn’t prompt, i should be in trouble to move my data in Google drive to other cloud storage service like Dropbox. </li>
<li>calendar : capture the next week schedule temporarily...</li>
<li>map : open street map</li>
<li>search : using duckduckgo</li>
<h6><i style="color:#222222">why is duckduckgo good?<i></h6>
<li>hangout : skype. But i guess i have no plan to make video call with more than 2 people next week. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3><i>How about Apple & Facebook?</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>Apple dominates my electronic hardwares(macbook, iPhone, iPad). </li>
<li>Facebook dominates my social relationship.
I think these two are more problematic than Google…(at least for me)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because, 
hardware is more hard to be replaced(tangible, expensive)
social relationship(into intimate level) is hard to be moved to other platform…
(since relationship isn’t my personal problem)</p>
