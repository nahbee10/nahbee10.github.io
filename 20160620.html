|| <i>Who is Nahee?
</i></h2>
<br>
Nahee was an artist who made her art works able to learn & grow from the feedback of viewers.
<br>
<h2>
|| <i>Which work?
</i></h2>
<br>
The one which I restore is one of her early works. She was not that good at using machine learning algorithm at that time. But it will be great if i can restore her immature implementation of the work so that viewers can feel realistically how the art pieces also have been started to think.
