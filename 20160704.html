<h1>Think about autonomous network</h1>

<p>I've already used autonomous network to deal my dear roaches.<br><br>

Newport extermination office and I have communicated via roach trap.<br><br>

My roommate and I cannot communicate with the office directly, since owner of our room didn't want us to do so(I don't know why).<br><br>

That's the reason why we needed to develop our own network system.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>

<h4>Journal---------------------------------------------------------------</h4> <br><br>

Jun 7 2016, they open the port(roach traps).<br><br>

Jun 14, 21 2016, there were several network problem - extermination officers didn't visit my place without any notice.<br><br>

Jun 28 2016, we finally succeeded to communicate each other! There were several messages(roaches) on the port. The officers understood the message and took some actions. <br><br>

Jul 3 2016, my roommate saw an urgent message(r...) on the sink. <br><br>

<h4>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>

<p>

* Extermination officers don't care about other spots(where roaches were discovered on Jul 3) where roaches love to be but no traps were installed. We needed to move the message(roach~) in the trap.<br><br>

* Roaches also care about privacy. - They usually hide and die at the corner of the trap. - Sometimes we couldn't catch the message(roach~).<br><br>

<h3><i>Other ideas..</i></h3><br><br>

1. Shhhhhhhhh- The sound of roach spray<br>
My roommate and I communicate using the sound of roach spray.<br>
"~~~~~~"<br>
(running)<br>
"Are there another roach?"<br>
-----------------------------<br>
And i could easily guess that other rooms also were suffered from the roach problem when i waited for my elevator --- "SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH(spray spray spray"<br>

<br><br>
2. My dear, capable hackers for my apartment - roaches<br>
Maybe they can be my decent deliver men. Who knows where roaches come from? They have enormous potential as AUTONOMOUS NETWORK!<br>
